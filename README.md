## Synopsis

Rain Reader is an open source tool for digitization of paper strip pluviograph charts. It automatically processes chart images using computer vision algorithms and allows users to correct the detected curve manually if the automatic process is not sufficiently accurate. 
The first version was made available in 2016.

## Motivation

Paper strip chart digitization was mostly done manually in the past. These methods are prone to errors and have proven to be heavily biased. This software aims to simplify, speed up and increase the accuracy of the process of reading paper charts. This way old data can be re-evaluated and new readings can be captured efficiently.

## Author

The software was developed at the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of computer and information science by Nejc Su≈°in, supervised by Assoc. Prof. PhD Peter Peer.
